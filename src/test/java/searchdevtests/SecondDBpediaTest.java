These blood cells are not fully developed and are called blasts or leukemia cells. Symptoms may include bleeding and bruising, feeling tired, fever, and an increased risk of infections. These symptoms occur due to a lack of normal blood cells. Diagnosis is typically made by blood tests or bone marrow biopsy.</Description><Classes><Class><Label>Disease</Label><URI>http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Disease</URI></Class></Classes><Categories><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Articles_containing_video_clips</URI></Category><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:RTT</URI></Category><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Leukemia</URI></Category><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Lymphatic_vessel_diseases</URI></Category></Categories><Refcount>50</Refcount></Result><Result><Label>Acute myeloid leukemia</Label><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acute_myeloid_leukemia</URI><Description>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells that build up in the bone marrow and blood and interfere with normal blood cells. Symptoms may include feeling tired, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Occasionally, spread may occur to the brain, skin, or gums. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.</Description><Classes><Class><Label>Disease</Label><URI>http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Disease</URI></Class></Classes><Categories><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Articles_containing_video_clips</URI></Category><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:RTT</URI></Category><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Acute_myeloid_leukemia</URI></Category></Categories><Refcount>32</Refcount></Result><Result><Label>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia</Label><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia</URI><Description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). Early on there are typically no symptoms. Later non-painful lymph node swelling, feeling tired, fever, night sweats, or weight loss for no clear reason may occur. Enlargement of the spleen and low red blood cells (anemia) may also occur. It typically worsens gradually over years.</Description><Classes><Class><Label>Disease</Label><URI>http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Disease</URI></Class></Classes><Categories><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:RTT</URI></Category><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Small_blue_round_cell_tumor</URI></Category><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia</URI></Category></Categories><Refcount>28</Refcount></Result><Result><Label>Hairy cell leukemia</Label><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hairy_cell_leukemia</URI><Description>Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon hematological malignancy characterized by an accumulation of abnormal B lymphocytes. It is usually classified as a sub-type of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Hairy cell leukemia makes up approximately 2% of all leukemias, with fewer than 2,000 new cases diagnosed annually in North America and Western Europe combined.</Description><Classes><Class><Label>Disease</Label><URI>http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Disease</URI></Class></Classes><Categories><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Lymphoid-related_cutaneous_conditions</URI></Category><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Lymphocytic_leukemia</URI></Category></Categories><Refcount>24</Refcount></Result><Result><Label>Lymphoid leukemia</Label><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lymphoid_leukemia</URI><Description>Lymphoid leukemias are a group of leukemias affecting circulating lymphocytes, a type of white blood cells. The lymphocytic leukemias are closely related to lymphomas of the lymphocytes, to the point that some of them are unitary disease entities that can be called by either name (for example, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma). Such diseases are all lymphoproliferative disorders. Most lymphoid leukemias involve a particular subtype of lymphocytes, the B cells.</Description><Classes><Class><Label>Disease</Label><URI>http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Disease</URI></Class></Classes><Categories><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Leukemia</URI></Category><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Lymphocytic_leukemia</URI></Category></Categories><Refcount>13</Refcount></Result><Result><Label>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia</Label><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia</URI><Description>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a cancer of the lymphoid line of blood cells characterized by the development of large numbers of immature lymphocytes.

It is a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found. It is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome.</Description><Classes><Class><Label>Disease</Label><URI>http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Disease</URI></Class></Classes><Categories><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Chronic_myeloid_leukemia</URI></Category></Categories><Refcount>14</Refcount></Result><Result><Label>Feline leukemia virus</Label><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feline_leukemia_virus</URI><Description>Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a retrovirus that infects cats. FeLV can be transmitted from infected cats when the transfer of saliva or nasal secretions is involved. If not defeated by the animal's immune system, the virus can cause diseases which can be lethal. FeLV is categorized into four subgroups, A, B, C and T. An infected cat has a combination of FeLV-A and one or more of the other subgroups. Symptoms, prognosis and treatment are all affected by subgroup.</Description><Classes/><Categories><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Animal_viral_diseases</URI></Category><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Animal_virology</URI></Category><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Gammaretroviruses</URI></Category><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Cat_diseases</URI></Category></Categories><Refcount>12</Refcount></Result><Result><Label>Myeloid leukemia</Label><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Myeloid_leukemia</URI><Description>Myeloid leukemia is a type of leukemia affecting myeloid tissue.

In APL, there is an abnormal accumulation of immature granulocytes called promyelocytes. The disease is characterized by a chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα or RARA) gene and is distinguished from other forms of AML by its responsiveness to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; also known as tretinoin) therapy. Acute promyelocytic leukemia was first characterized in 1957 by French and Norwegian physicians as a hyperacute fatal illness, with a median survival time of less than a week. Today, prognoses have drastically improved; 10-year survival rates are estimated to be approximately 80-90% according to one study.</Description><Classes><Class><Label>Disease</Label><URI>http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Disease</URI></Class></Classes><Categories><Category><URI>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Acute_myeloid_leukemia</URI></Category></Categories><Refcount>11</Refcount></Result></ArrayOfResults>
